// A geometric series is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, 
// non-zero number called the common ratio. The general form of a geometric series is:

// ```
// a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^n
// ```

// Where:
// - `a` is the first term of the series.
// - `r` is the common ratio by which each term is multiplied to get the next term.
// - `n` is the number of terms in the series.

// Geometric series can either be infinite, extending infinitely, or finite, with a specific number of terms. 
// The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

// ```
// S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)
// ```

// Where `S` is the sum of the series.

// For example, in the series 1, 3, 9, 27, ..., the first term `a` is 1, and the common ratio `r` is 3. 
// This series is a geometric series because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3.
